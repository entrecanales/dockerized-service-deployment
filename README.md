Hi! The goal of this project is to build a simple Node.js service, dockerize and deploy it with GitHub Actions.

There are 4 parts to this project:

    Step 1 — Creating a Node.js service
    Step 2 — Dockerizing the Node.js service
    Step 3 — Setup a remote Linux Server
    Step 4 — Deploying the Dockerized Node.js service to a remote server using GitHub Actions

This is the project link: https://roadmap.sh/projects/dockerized-service-deployment
